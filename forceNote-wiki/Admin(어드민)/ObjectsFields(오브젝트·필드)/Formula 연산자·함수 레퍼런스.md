# Formula 연산자·함수 레퍼런스

> 수식(수식 필드·검증 규칙·승인 프로세스·워크플로 등)에서 쓰는 연산자·함수 전수 레퍼런스 — Math/Logical/Text 연산자 + Date&Time·Logical·Math·Text·Summary·Advanced 함수 119종을 컨텍스트별로.

## 개요

> Use these operators and functions when building formulas. All functions are available everywhere that you can include a formula, such as formula fields, validation rules, approval processes, and workflow rules, unless otherwise specified. Within an email template, merge fields can only be used in formula functions and operations when the merge field belongs to the record that the email is related to. Otherwise, these fields don't resolve. Extraneous spaces in these samples are ignored.

즉 별도 명시가 없는 한, 여기의 모든 함수는 **수식을 넣을 수 있는 모든 곳**(수식 필드·검증 규칙·승인 프로세스·워크플로 규칙 등)에서 사용할 수 있다. 단 **이메일 템플릿** 안에서는 병합 필드(merge field)가 그 이메일과 연관된 레코드에 속할 때만 함수·연산에서 사용 가능하며, 그렇지 않으면 필드가 해석되지 않는다.

## Math Operators

| 이름 | 설명 |
|---|---|
| `+` (Add) | Calculates the sum of two values. |
| `-` (Subtract) | Calculates the difference of two values. |
| `*` (Multiply) | Multiplies its values. |
| `/` (Divide) | Divides its values. |
| `^` (Exponentiation) | Raises a number to the power of a specified number. |
| `()` (Open/Closed Parenthesis) | Specifies that the expressions within the parentheses are evaluated first. All other expressions are evaluated using standard operator precedence. |

## Logical Operators

| 이름 | 설명 |
|---|---|
| `=` and `==` (Equal) | Evaluates if two values are equivalent. The = and == operators are interchangeable. |
| `<>` and `!=` (Not Equal) | Evaluates if two values aren't equivalent. |
| `<` (Less Than) | Evaluates if a value is less than the value that follows this symbol. |
| `>` (Greater Than) | Evaluates if a value is greater than the value that follows this symbol. |
| `<=` (Less Than or Equal) | Evaluates if a value is less than or equal to the value that follows. |
| `>=` (Greater Than or Equal) | Evaluates if a value is greater than or equal to the value that follows. |
| `&&` (And) | Evaluates if two values or expressions are both true. Alternative to logical function AND. |

| `DATE` | Returns a date value from the year, month, and day values that you enter. Salesforce displays an error on the detail page if the value of the DATE function in a formula field is an invalid date, such as February 29 in a non-leap year. |
| `DATEVALUE` | Returns a date value for a date/time or text expression. |
| `DATETIMEVALUE` | Returns a year, month, day, and GMT time value. |
| `DAY` | Returns a day of the month in the form of a number from 1 through 31. |
| `DAYOFYEAR` | Returns the day of the calendar year in the form of a number from 1 through 366. |
| `FORMATDURATION` | Formats the number of seconds with optional days, or the difference between times or dateTimes as HH:MI:SS. |
| `HOUR` | Returns the local time hour value without the date in the form of a number from 1 through 24. |
| `ISOWEEK` | Returns the ISO 8601-week number, from 1 through 53, for the given date, ensuring that the first week starts on a Monday. |

| `NOW` | Returns a date/time representing the current moment. |
| `SECOND` | Returns a seconds value in the form of a number from 0 through 60. |
| `TIMENOW` | Returns a time value in GMT representing the current moment. Use this function instead of the NOW function if you only want to track time, without a date. |
| `TIMEVALUE` | Returns the time value without the date, such as business hours. |
| `TODAY` | Returns the current date as a date data type. |
| `UNIXTIMESTAMP` | Returns the number of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 for the given date, or number of seconds in the day for a time. |
| `WEEKDAY` | Returns the day of the week for the given date, using 1 for Sunday, 2 for Monday, through 7 for Saturday. |
| `YEAR` | Returns the four-digit year in number format of a given date. |

## Logical Functions

| 이름 | 설명 |
|---|---|
| `AND` | Returns a TRUE response if all values are true, and returns a FALSE response if one or more values are false. |
| `BLANKVALUE` | Determines if an expression has a value, and returns a substitute expression if it doesn't. If the expression has a value, returns the value of the expression. |
| `CASE` | Checks a given expression against a series of values. If the expression is equal to a value in the series, returns the corresponding result. If it isn't equal to a value in the series, returns the else_result. |
| `IF` | Determines if expressions are true or false. Returns a given value if true and another value if false. |
| `ISBLANK` | Determines if an expression has a value, and returns TRUE if it doesn't. If it contains a value, returns FALSE. |
| `ISCLONE` | Checks if the record is a clone of another record, and returns TRUE if one item is a clone. Otherwise, returns FALSE. |
| `ISNEW` | Checks if the formula is running during the creation of a new record, and returns TRUE if it is. If an existing record is being updated, returns FALSE. |
| `ISNULL` | Determines if an expression is null (blank), and returns TRUE if it is. If it contains a value, returns FALSE. You must use ISBLANK instead of ISNULL in new formulas. ISBLANK has the same functionality as ISNULL, but also supports text fields. Salesforce continues to support ISNULL, so you don't change any existing formulas. |
| `ISNUMBER` | Determines if a text value is a number, and returns TRUE if it is. Otherwise, returns FALSE. |
| `NOT` | Returns FALSE for TRUE and TRUE for FALSE. |
| `NULLVALUE` | Determines if an expression is null (blank) and returns a substitute expression if it is. If the expression isn't blank, returns the value of the expression. You must use BLANKVALUE instead of NULLVALUE in new formulas. BLANKVALUE has the same functionality as NULLVALUE, but it also supports text fields. Salesforce continues to support NULLVALUE, so changing the existing formulas isn't necessary. |
| `OR` | Determines if expressions are true or false. Returns TRUE if any expression is true, and returns FALSE if all expressions are false. |
| `PRIORVALUE` | Returns the previous value of a field. |
